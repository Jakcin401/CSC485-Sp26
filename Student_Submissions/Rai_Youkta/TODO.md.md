Goals for this week:

- [CHECK] Create a repo for First Project
- [] Make sure to add the first DataSet I will be working with within the Created repo  
- [CHECK] Sleep
- [CHECK] Plan classes for next week

I was able to make some edit to my proposel and mannage to create a repo in Github.
I thought I had the dataset all set but It seems I have to line by line make sure the "Names" features are consistent.
This took a while and I am still working on it. 

I plan to make sure the coming week I am set with my dataset and can work on some exploratory analysis

Goals for this week:

- [] Push the completed Dataset that I currently have
- [CHECK] Think of some approaches to the Project
- [CHECK] Sleep
- [CHECK] Plan classes for next week

I was not able to complete the dataset as I found more to add onto it. I am looking foward to talking to the professor 
to find other sources that I could use for abilities if I plan to add that to my data analysis. I currently plan to
Scrapp any suggestion that the professor had and hopefully complete my dataset.

- [Check] Scrap the SMOGON stats website to add abilities usage of Pokemons 
- [Check] Think of some approaches to the Project
	- [] Make many bar graphes
- [Check] Sleep
- [Check] Plan classes for next week

I was able to convert the JSON files into dataframes in R making them more easy to use for future graphs and analysis. 
I plan to make graphs and find results that show difference between lower elo vs higher elo. I plan to compare their respected
types, usage, and prefered teammates. I plan also to incorporat abilities and moves that the pokemom uses, but I currently
have little idea towards the approach in using them.

- [CHECK] Make Bar graphs 
- [] Make a Cord graph
	- [Create a Cord Graph for Pokemon's teammates]
- [CHECK] Think of questions that I want to answer in this research
	-[] Found answers 
- [CHECK] Sleep
- [CHECK] Plan classes for next week

I was able to make clean Bar graphs and found that a Cord was not going to work with the way my dataset's layout.
So, I created a Sankey Diagram instead. I plan to try to finish my search in using Machine Learning techniques, but so 
far I am planning to just make sure I have everything ready before that step.
